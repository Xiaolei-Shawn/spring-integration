	<title>What's new in Spring Integration 3.0?</title>
	<para>
		This chapter provides an overview of the new features and improvements
		that have been introduced with Spring Integration 3.0 If you are interested
		in even more detail, please take a look at the Issue Tracker tickets that
		were resolved as part of the 3.0 development process.

		<title>New Components</title>
		<section id="3.0-tcp-events">
			<title>TCP/IP Connection Events and Connection Management</title>
			<para>
				The (supplied) <classname>TcpConnection</classname>s now emit
				<interfacename>ApplicationEvent</interfacename>s (specifically
				<classname>TcpConnectionEvent</classname>s) when connections are
				opened, closed, or an exception occurs. This allows applications
				to be informed of changes to TCP connections using the normal
				Spring <interfacename>ApplicationListener</interfacename>
				mechanism.
			</para>
			<para>
				<classname>AbstractTcpConnection</classname> has been renamed
				<classname>TcpConnectionSupport</classname>; custom connections that
				are subclasses of this class, can use its methods to publish events.
				Similarly, <classname>AbstractTcpConnectionInterceptor</classname> has
				been renamed to <classname>TcpConnectionInterceptorSupport</classname>.
			</para>
			<para>
				In addition, a new <code>&lt;int-ip:tcp-connection-event-inbound-channel-adapter/&gt;</code>
				is provided; by default, this adapter sends all <classname>TcpConnectionEvent</classname>s
				to a <interfacename>Channel</interfacename>.
			</para>
			<para>
				Further, the TCP Connection Factories, now provide a new method
				<code>getOpenConnectionIds()</code>, which returns a list of identifiers for all
				open connections; this allows applications, for example, to broadcast to all
				open connections.
			</para>
			<para>
				Finally, the connection factories also provide a new method
				<code>closeConnection(String connectionId)</code> which allows applications
				to explicitly close a connection using its ID.
			</para>
			<para>
				For more information see <xref linkend="tcp-events"/>.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-syslog">
			<title>Syslog Support</title>
			<para>
				Building on the 2.2 <classname>SyslogToMapTransformer</classname> Spring
				Integration 3.0 now introduces
				<code>UDP</code> and <code>TCP</code> inbound channel adapters especially tailored
				for receiving SYSLOG messages. For more information, see
				<xref linkend="syslog"/>.
			</para>
		</section>

		<title>General Changes</title>

		<section id="3.0-corr-endpoint-empty-groups">
			<title>Aggregator 'empty-group-min-timeout' property</title>
				<para><classname>AbstractCorrelatingMessageHandler</classname> provides a new property
					<code>empty-group-min-timeout</code>
					to allow empty group expiry to run on a longer schedule than expiring partial groups. Empty groups will
					not be removed from the <interfacename>MessageStore</interfacename> until they have not been modified
					for at least this number of milliseconds. For more information see <xref linkend="aggregator-config"/>.
				</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-o-t-s-t">
			<title>ObjectToStringTransformer Improvements</title>
			<para>
				This transformer now correctly transforms <code>byte[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>
				payloads to <classname>String</classname>. For more information see <xref linkend="transformer"/>.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-ws-outbound-uri-substitution">
			<title>Web Service Outbound URI Configuration</title>
			<para>
				Web Service Outbound Gateway 'uri' attribute now supports <code>&lt;uri-variable/&gt;</code> substitution for all
				URI-schemes supported by Spring Web Services. For more information see <xref linkend="outbound-uri"/>.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-xFTP-ib">
			<title>(S)FTP(S) Inbound Adapters</title>
			<para>
				Previously, there was no way to override the default filter used to process files retrieved
				from a remote server. The <code>filter</code> attribute determines which files are retrieved
				but the <classname>FileReadingMessageSource</classname> uses an
				<classname>AcceptOnceFileListFilter</classname>. This means that if a new copy of a file
				is retrieved, with the same name as a previously copied file, no message was sent from the
				adapter.
			</para>
			<para>
				With this release, a new attribute <code>local-filter</code> allows you to override the
				default filter, for example with an <classname>AcceptAllFileListFilter</classname>, or some
				other custom filter.
			</para>
			<para>
				For users that wish the behavior of the <classname>AcceptOnceFileListFilter</classname>
				to be maintained across JVM executions, a custom filter that retains state, perhaps on
				the file system, can now be configured.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-xFTP-gw">
			<title>(S)FTP(S) Gateways</title>
			<para>
				The gateways now support the <code>mv</code> command, enabling the renaming of remote
				files.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-jdbc-mysql-v5_6_4">
			<title>JDBC Message Store Improvements</title>
			<para>
				<emphasis>Spring Integration 3.0</emphasis> adds a new set of DDL
				scripts for <emphasis>MySQL</emphasis> version 5.6.4 and higher.
				Now <emphasis>MySQL</emphasis> supports <emphasis>fractional
				seconds</emphasis> and is thus improving the FIFO ordering when
				polling from a MySQL-based Message Store. For more information,
				please see <xref linkend="jdbc-message-store-generic"/>.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Jackson Support (JSON)</title>
			<para>
				A new abstraction for JSON conversion has been introduced. Implementations for Jackson 1.x
				and Jackson 2 are currently provided, with the version being determined by presence on
				the classpath. Previously, only Jackson 1.x was supported. For more information,
				see 'JSON Transformers' in <xref linkend="transformer"/>.
